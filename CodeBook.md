Assignment specs: write a R script which
	  * 1	  Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
	  * 2	  Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
	  * 3	  Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
	  * 4	  Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
	  * 5	  From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The run_analysis.R script is intended to be run from within the upper-most level of the original UCI HAR Dataset directory.
```
The R object “my_final.df” is the second, independent tidy data set.
